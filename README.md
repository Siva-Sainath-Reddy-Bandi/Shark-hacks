# Shark-hacks

The website does the following functions: Seller Dashboard: It has the transactions and stock features where sellers update their transactions of animal sales for authorities to monitor by sending pics, text, or sheets. The same with stock where they send images of the stock of their animals by sending pics of how they are maintained and sold. So that authorities can monitor to see if proper sanitation and storage guidelines are being practiced. ML model: In this we made a ML model in which shark images are scanned and then sharks with fins and without fins are found out by the model. This is to solve the problem of shark-finning. It uses data of the images to scan and learn on its own through supervised learning to find the sharks with and without fins. Report feature: This is where users can report any attacks on animals or any illegal trade or any dire animals in need. We made this feature so that the community can help in solving animal related problems and also report illegal animal related activities.
